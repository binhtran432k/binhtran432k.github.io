# My Personal Portfolio

Welcome to the repository for my **Personal Portfolio**! This project serves as
my personal website, showcasing my work, skills, and background. Itâ€™s a
minimalist, self-built solution designed to focus on efficiency, performance,
and creativity.

## Features

### Built with Simplicity and Efficiency

- **Internal Static Site Generator (SSG):** Custom-built on top of **[Van
  JS](https://vanjs.org/)** to minimize dependencies and build tools.
- **[Bun](https://bun.sh/):** Used to minify JavaScript and CSS for faster load
  times and to run the local development server efficiently.

### Styling and Effects

- **Pure CSS:** No frameworksâ€”just clean, handcrafted styles for optimal
  performance and aesthetics.
- **WebGL:** Used for fancy 2D image effects with shaders, creating dynamic and
  visually appealing motion without third-party plugins or libraries.

### Seamless Deployment

- **GitHub Actions:** Automated CI/CD pipeline to build and deploy the
  portfolio to GitHub Pages, ensuring every update goes live effortlessly.

### Pages

- **Homepage (`/`):** Introduces me, my work, and my interests in a simple yet
  elegant layout [[link](https://binhtran432k.com)].
- **Resume Page (`/resume`):** Dedicated page to showcase my detailed resume
  [[link](https://binhtran432k.com/resume)].

## Why Build This?

This project is a reflection of my skills and philosophy as a developer. By
using self-built tools and minimal third-party dependencies, I aim to create a
site that is:

- Fully customized to represent my personal style.
