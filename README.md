# Portfolio Project

This project is a personal portfolio website built using Perseus, a
high-performance Rust-based web framework. It showcases my skills and
experience in web development.

## Features

- **Clean and responsive design**: The website adapts seamlessly to different
  screen sizes, ensuring a great user experience across devices
- **Interactive elements**: The portfolio may include elements like smooth
  animations, interactive components, or micro-interactions to enhance user
  engagement
- **Project highlights**: Each project is presented with a clear description,
  relevant technologies used, and potentially links to live demos or source
  code
- **Contact information**: Provides an easy way for potential employers or
  collaborators to reach out

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: Perseus (Rust)
- **Styling**: CSS (potentially with a CSS-in-JS library)
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages (static site hosting)

## Live demo
